This is a sample input file for ABIN.

It shows also how to use some more obscure settings.

&general

conatom=0,		! number of constrained atoms
irest=0,		! Should we restart from restart.xyz? (ignoring mini.dat)

mdtype='md',		! 'md' = classical MD
nwalk=1,		! number of random walkers 
nstep=5000,		! number of steps
dt=20.,			! timestep [au]
irandom=111313,  	! random seed

nwrite=10,		! how often some output should be printed (estimators etc.)
nwritex=5,		! how often should we print coordinates?
nrest=10,		! how often we print restart files?
