# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status,
# but before anything has been pushed.
# If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
# You can always skip the hook by `git push --no-verify`

# To install this hook:
# cp pre-push.hook .git/hooks/pre-push;chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
