Test that temp0 works correctly.

test QMMM one more time with luciferin

optimize the value of tau0, test for different temperatures.
Check this value for larger clusters.
in terachem, they use 1000fs, but with a bit different definition, so it translates into our 
tau=0.159
I should really test this for larger system.....

! For using GLE with REMD, we need to input multiple seeds...make irandom an array
! REMD with ab initio does not yet work
