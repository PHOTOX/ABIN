  abstract = {A practical approach to treat nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) effects
	in simulations of condensed phases, such as enzymes, is via Feynman
	path integral (PI) formulations. Typically, the standard primitive
	approximation (PA) is employed in enzymatic PI simulations. Nonetheless,
	these PI simulations are computationally demanding due to the large
	number of discretizations, or beads, required to obtain converged
	results. The efficiency of PI simulations may be greatly improved
	if higher order factorizations of the density matrix operator are
	employed. Herein, we compare the results of model calculations obtained
	employing the standard PA, the improved operator of Takahashi and
	Imada (TI), and several gradient based forward corrector algorithms
	due to Chin (CH). The quantum partition, function is computed for
	the harmonic oscillator, Morse, symmetric, and asymmetric double
	well potentials. These potentials are simple models for nuclear quantum
	effects, such as zero point energy and tunneling. It is shown that
	a unique set Of CH parameters may be employed for a variety of systems.
	Additionally, the nuclear QM effects of a water molecule, treated
	with density functional theory, are computed., Finally, we derive
	a practical perturbation expression for efficient computation of
	isotope effects in chemical systems using the staging algorithm.
	This new isotope effect approach is tested in conjunction with the
	PA, TI, and CH methods to compute the equilibrium isotope effect
	in the Schiff base-oxyanion keto-enol tautomerism in the cofactor
	pyridoxal-5'-phosphate in the enzyme alanine racemase. The study
	of the different factorization methods reveals that the higher-order
	actions converge substantially faster than the PA approach, at a
	moderate computational cost.},

  abstract = {A computer simulation study of quantum effects in methane, butane,

	state points in the liquid region using novel extended system, multiple
	time step, constant pressure, path integral molecular dynamics methodology.
	In addition, the results of classical calculations are reported to
	provide a useful reference. Liquid butane is used as a test case
	on which to compare the predictions of two empirical force fields,
	CHARMM22 and AMBER95. Comparisons are made to experiment. Briefly,
	the models predict that quantum effects lead to an increase in molar
	volume of approximately 2 cm3/mole i.e., relative to a classical
	calculation. However, a slight unphysical hydrogen–deuterium isotope
	effect is, also, observed. This may be caused by an incorrect parametrization
	of the anisotropy of the potential or by a reduction in the magnitude
	of the intermolecular induced dipole-induced dipole dispersion coefficient
	with increasing isotope mass that has not been parametrized in the
	force fields. In addition, the results show an interesting zero-point
	energy effect. The intramolecular regions of the radial distribution
	function exhibit less structure at lower temperatures than at higher
	temperatures. This is the inverse of the prediction of the model
	in the classical limit. The quantum effect occurs because the bulk
	density decreases faster than the intramolecular degrees of freedom
	lose zero-point energy as temperature increases in the highly harmonic
	intramolecular potential model employed in the calculations. Nonetheless,
	the phenomena is not likely to be an artifact and careful experiments
	could observe it. Finally, the efficiency of the path molecular dynamics
	methods employed in the studies are demonstrated on both serial and

  abstract = {We examine the short-time accuracy of a class of approximate quantum
	dynamical techniques that includes the centroid molecular dynamics
	(CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods. Both of
	these methods are based on the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)
	technique for calculating the exact static equilibrium properties
	of quantum mechanical systems. For Kubo-transformed real-time correlation
	functions involving operators that are linear functions of positions
	or momenta, the RPMD and (adiabatic) CMD approximations differ only
	in the choice of the artificial mass matrix of the system of ring
	polymer beads that is employed in PIMD. The obvious ansatz for a
	general method of this type is therefore to regard the elements of
	the PIMD (or Parrinello-Rahman) mass matrix as an adjustable set
	of parameters that can be chosen to improve the accuracy of the resulting
	approximation. We show here that this ansatz leads uniquely to the
	RPMD approximation when the criterion that is used to select the
	mass matrix is the short-time accuracy of the Kubo-transformed correlation
	function. In particular, we show that the leading error in the RPMD
	position autocorrelation function is O(t(8)) and the error in the
	velocity autocorrelation function is O(t(6)), for a general anharmonic
	potential. The corresponding errors in the CMD approximation are
	O(t(6)) and O(t(4)), respectively. (c) 2006 American Institute of

  abstract = {The chemical composition of small organic molecules is often very
	similar to amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids,
	and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force
	field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with
	a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields
	in order to test the ability of existing force fields to reproduce
	some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy
	of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant
	volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric
	expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over
	1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations
	of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric
	constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three
	molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) as
	a function of the temperature have been made, based on experimental
	data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them.
	To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics
	method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys.2003, 119, 11792), which allows
	one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density
	of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function.
	The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular
	simulation package, named g\_dos, and a detailed expos\'{e} of the
	underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to
	establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA
	(all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized
	Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i.e., particularly
	difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future
	force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules
	were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats
	and barostats, treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system
	size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization
	from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM
	General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J.
	Comput. Chem.2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find
	that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than
	GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface

  abstract = {We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of quantum many-body systems
	using several methods based on classical calculations. These approaches
	are compared for the melting of Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters, where
	path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results are also available. First,
	we examine two quasiclassical approaches where the classical potential
	is replaced by effective potentials accounting for quantum corrections
	of low order in h. Of the Wigner-Kirkwood and Feynman-Hibbs effective
	potentials, only the latter is found to be in quantitative agreement
	with quantum simulations. However, both potentials fail to describe
	even qualitatively the low-temperature regime, where quantum effects
	are strong. Our second approach is based on the harmonic superposition
	approximation, but with explicit quantum oscillators. In its basic
	form, this approach is in good qualitative agreement with PIMC results,
	and becomes more accurate at low temperatures. By including anharmonic
	corrections in the form of temperature-dependent frequency shifts,
	the agreement between the quantum superposition and the PIMC results
	becomes quantitative for the caloric curve of neon clusters. The
	superposition method is then applied to larger clusters to study
	the influence of quantum delocalization on the melting and premelting
	of LJ(19), LJ(31), LJ(38), and LJ(55). The quantum character strongly
	affects the thermodynamics via changes in the ground state structure
	due to increasing zero-point energies. Finally, we focus on the lowest
	temperature range, and we estimate the Debye temperatures of argon
	clusters and their size variation. A strong sensitivity to the cluster
	structure is found, especially when many surface atoms reorganize
	as in the anti-Mackay/Mackay transition. In the large size regime,
	the Debye temperature smoothly rises to its bulk limit, but still
	depends slightly on the growth sequence considered. (C) 2001 American

	Here we discuss how these techniques can be made dramatically more

	in terms of computational cost. To achieve this goal we introduce
	path integral quantum mechanics estimators based on free energy perturbation,

	isotope. We use as an example the calculation of the free energy

	water, and of the fractionation of those isotopes between the liquid
	and the vapor phase. In doing so, we demonstrate and discuss quantitatively

	properties of condensed phase systems at the expense of introducing
	an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical
	vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range
	of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge.
	Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation
	(PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free
	path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed
	colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation
	(GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized
	sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared
	with that of the more conventional Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat
	for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water
	and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new
	PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat
	while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation.
	The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum
	sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that
	these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application
	in many future PIMD simulations.},

	energy surface (PES) construction and fitting is demonstrated. An
	interpolating moving least-squares (IMLS) method is developed with
	the flexibility to fit various ab initio data: (1) energies, (2)
	energies and gradients, or (3) energies, gradients, and Hessian data.
	The method is automated and flexible so that a PES can be optimally
	generated for trajectories, spectroscopy, or other applications.
	High efficiency is achieved by employing local IMLS in which fitting
	coefficients are stored at a limited number of expansion points,
	thus eliminating the need to perform weighted least-squares fits
	each time the potential is evaluated. An automatic point selection
	scheme based on the difference in two successive orders of IMLS fits
	is used to determine where new ab initio data need to be calculated
	for the most efficient fitting of the PES. A simple scan of the coordinate
	is shown to work well to identify these maxima in one dimension,
	but this search strategy scales poorly with dimension. We demonstrate
	the efficacy of using conjugate gradient minimizations on the difference
	surface to locate optimal data point placement in high dimensions.
	Results that are indicative of the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability
	are presented for a one-dimensional model potential (Morse) as well
	as for three-dimensional (HCN), six-dimensional (HOOH), and nine-dimensional
	(CH4) molecular PESs.},

	effective potential in a molecular-dynamics code. The reference potential
	chosen for water is a new central force model related to the one
	proposed in the 1970s by Lemberg and Stillinger [J. Chem. Phys. 62,
	1677 (1975)]. The evolution of the thermodynamics, the structure,
	the diffusivity, and the dynamics in light and heavy water is investigated
	over a large range of temperature and is compared with experimental

	effects are significant near ambient conditions and vanish with increasing
	temperature less drastically than generally assumed. The most affected
	quantity is the self-diffusion coefficient for which is predicted
	a marked increase of the isotopic ratio (D-H2O/D-D2O) in going into
	the supercooled region. The accuracy of the results and the very
	low cost in computer time make the Feynman-Hibbs approach a valuable

  journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {131},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Numerous studies have identified large quantum mechanical effects
	in the dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these
	effects may have been overestimated due to the use of rigid water
	models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions
	were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this,
	we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F,
	in which the O-H stretches are described by Morse-type functions.
	We have parametrized this model to give the correct liquid structure,
	diffusion coefficient, and infrared absorption frequencies in quantum
	(path integral-based) simulations. The model also reproduces the
	experimental temperature variation of the liquid density and affords
	reasonable agreement with the experimental melting temperature of
	hexagonal ice at atmospheric pressure. By comparing classical and
	quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical
	fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational
	relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is
	much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of empirical
	water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless
	of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The
	small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena.
	Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize
	the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with
	a larger diffusion coefficient. However, this is offset by intramolecular
	zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry
	resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions,
	and a slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations
	of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we
	find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability
	of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the
	infrared absorption spectrum. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

	within the SAFT-VR framework to model the monomer segment interactions
	(Lafitte et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 024509), is used for the
	study of second-order derivative properties and phase equilibria
	of alcohols and 1-alcohol + n-alkane binary mixtures. For this purpose,
	a variable repulsive potential is used to induce nonconformal interactions

	contact value of the radial distribution function, and they enhance
	the SAFT theory performance in the application to associating substances.
	When dealing with pure alcohols and 1-alcohol + n-alkane binary mixtures,
	an accurate description of both phase equilibria and second-order
	derivatives is obtained with a single set of molecular parameters.
	To explore the predictive ability limit of the model we have particularly
	focused our attention on secondary derivative properties, which display
	singularities due to the formation of aggregates. With this approach,
	we have found that the model is able to reproduce accurately the
	complex behavior of the isobaric heat capacity of alcohols as, for
	instance, the maximum versus temperature in the compressed liquid
	region. Furthermore, in the case of 1-hexanol + n-hexane binary mixtures,
	the proposed equation is found to capture the association effects
	on the pressure and temperature dependence of the isobaric thermal
	expansivity. These two special features, which to our knowledge have
	never been described by a theoretical model, emphasize both the validity
	of the changes in the model proposed and the physical meaning of
	the molecular parameters obtained in this study.},

	of state (DoS) functions (including the normal modes of translation,
	rotation, and intramolecular vibration motions) are determined from
	the Fourier transform of the corresponding velocity autocorrelation
	functions. A fluidicity parameter (f), extracted from the thermodynamic
	state of the system derived from the same MD, is used to partition
	the translation and rotation modes into a diffusive, gas-like component
	(with 3Nf degrees of freedom) and a nondiffusive, solid-like component.
	The thermodynamic properties, including the absolute value of entropy,
	are then obtained by applying quantum statistics to the solid component
	and applying hard sphere/rigid rotor thermodynamics to the gas component.
	The 2PT method produces exact thermodynamic properties of the system
	in two limiting states: the nondiffusive solid state (where the fluidicity
	is zero) and the ideal gas state (where the fluidicity becomes unity).
	We examine the 2PT entropy for various water models (F3C, SPC, SPC/E,
	TIP3P, and TIP4P-Ew) at ambient conditions and find good agreement
	with literature results obtained based on other simulation techniques.
	We also validate the entropy of water in the liquid and vapor phases
	along the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve from the triple point to
	the critical point. We show that this method produces converged liquid
	phase entropy in tens of picoseconds, making it an efficient means

  abstract = {A quantum simulation of an imaginary time path integral typically
	requires around n times more computational effort than the corresponding
	classical simulation, where n is the number of ring polymer beads
	(or imaginary time slices) used in the calculation. However, this
	estimate neglects the fact that the potential energies of many systems
	can be decomposed into a sum of rapidly varying short-range and slowly
	varying long-range contributions. For such systems, the computational
	effort of the path integral simulation can be reduced considerably
	by evaluating the long-range forces on a contracted ring polymer
	with fewer beads than are needed to evaluate the short-range forces.
	This idea is developed and then illustrated with an application to
	a flexible model of liquid water in which the intramolecular forces
	are evaluated with 32 beads, the oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones forces
	with seven, and the intermolecular electrostatic forces with just
	five. The resulting static and dynamic properties are within a few
	percent of those of a full 32-bead calculation, and yet they are
	obtained with a computational effort less than six times (rather
	than 32 times) that of a classical simulation. We hope that this
	development will encourage future studies of quantum mechanical fluctuations
	in liquid water and aqueous solutions and in many other systems with
	similar interaction potentials. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {Implementation of Dyson orbitals for coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion
	coupled-cluster wave functions with single and double substitutions
	is described and demonstrated by examples. Both ionizations from
	the ground and electronically excited states are considered. Dyson
	orbitals are necessary for calculating electronic factors of angular
	distributions of photoelectrons, Compton profiles, electron momentum
	spectra, etc, and can be interpreted as states of the leaving electron.
	Formally, Dyson orbitals represent the overlap between an initial
	N-electron wave function and the N-1 electron wave function of the
	corresponding ionized system. For the ground state ionization, Dyson
	orbitals are often similar to the corresponding Hartree-Fock molecular
	orbitals (MOs); however, for ionization from electronically excited
	states Dyson orbitals include contributions from several MOs and
	their shapes are more complex. The theory is applied to calculating
	the Dyson orbitals for ionization of formaldehyde from the ground
	and electronically excited states. Partial-wave analysis is employed
	to compute the probabilities to find the ejected electron in different
	angular momentum states using the freestanding and Coulomb wave representations
	of the ionized electron. Rydberg states are shown to yield higher
	angular momentum electrons, as compared to valence states of the
	same symmetry. Likewise, faster photoelectrons are most likely to
	have higher angular momentum.},

  abstract = {The path-integral molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics
	methods have been applied to investigate the behavior of liquid water
	at ambient conditions starting from a recently developed simple point
	charge/flexible (SPC/Fw) model. Several quantum structural, thermodynamic,
	and dynamical properties have been computed and compared to the corresponding
	classical values, as well as to the available experimental data.
	The path-integral molecular dynamics simulations show that the inclusion
	of quantum effects results in a less structured liquid with a reduced
	amount of hydrogen bonding in comparison to its classical analog.
	The nuclear quantization also leads to a smaller dielectric constant
	and a larger diffusion coefficient relative to the corresponding
	classical values. Collective and single molecule time correlation
	functions show a faster decay than their classical counterparts.
	Good agreement with the experimental measurements in the low-frequency
	region is obtained for the quantum infrared spectrum, which also
	shows a higher intensity and a redshift relative to its classical
	analog. A modification of the original parametrization of the SPC/Fw
	model is suggested and tested in order to construct an accurate quantum
	model, called q-SPC/Fw, for liquid water. The quantum results for
	several thermodynamic and dynamical properties computed with the
	new model are shown to be in a significantly better agreement with
	the experimental data. Finally, a force-matching approach was applied
	to the q-SPC/Fw model to derive an effective quantum force field
	for liquid water in which the effects due to the nuclear quantization
	are explicitly distinguished from those due to the underlying molecular
	interactions. Thermodynamic and dynamical properties computed using
	standard classical simulations with this effective quantum potential
	are found in excellent agreement with those obtained from significantly
	more computationally demanding full centroid molecular dynamics simulations.
	The present results suggest that the inclusion of nuclear quantum
	effects into an empirical model for water enhances the ability of
	such model to faithfully represent experimental data, presumably
	through an increased ability of the model itself to capture realistic
	physical effects.},

  abstract = {We validate here the Two-Phase Thermodynamics (2PT) method for calculating
	the standard molar entropies and heat capacities of common liquids.
	In 2PT, the thermodynamics of the system is related to the total
	density of states (DoS), obtained from the Fourier Transform of the
	velocity autocorrelation function. For liquids this DoS is partitioned
	into a diffusional component modeled as diffusion of a hard sphere
	gas plus a solid component for which the DoS($\upsilon$) → 0 as $\upsilon$→
	0 as for a Debye solid. Thermodynamic observables are obtained by
	integrating the DoS with the appropriate weighting functions. In
	the 2PT method, two parameters are extracted from the DoS self-consistently
	to describe diffusional contributions: the fraction of diffusional
	modes, f, and DoS(0). This allows 2PT to be applied consistently
	and without re-parameterization to simulations of arbitrary liquids.
	We find that the absolute entropy of the liquid can be determined
	accurately from a single short MD trajectory (20 ps) after the system
	is equilibrated, making it orders of magnitude more efficient than
	commonly used perturbation and umbrella sampling methods. Here, we
	present the predicted standard molar entropies for fifteen common
	solvents evaluated from molecular dynamics simulations using the
	AMBER, GAFF, OPLS AA/L and Dreiding II forcefields. Overall, we find
	that all forcefields lead to good agreement with experimental and
	previous theoretical values for the entropy and very good agreement
	in the heat capacities. These results validate 2PT as a robust and
	efficient method for evaluating the thermodynamics of liquid phase
	systems. Indeed 2PT might provide a practical scheme to improve the
	intermolecular terms in forcefields by comparing directly to thermodynamic

	spectra of small water clusters, ranging from monomer to octamer.
	The role of quantum and thermal effects on the structure of the water
	photoelectron spectra is discussed within the ab initio path integral
	molecular dynamics (PIMD) framework. We have used the PIMD method
	with up to 40 beads to sample the ground state quantum distribution
	at temperature T = 180 K. We have thoroughly tested the performance
	of various density functionals (B3LYP, BHandHLYP, M06HF, BNL, LC-$\omega$PBE,
	and CAM-B3LYP) for the ionization process description. The benchmarking
	based on a comparison of simulated photoelectron spectra to experimental
	data and high level equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled
	clusters with singles and doubles calculations has singled out the
	BHandHLYP and LC-$\omega$PBE functionals as the most reliable ones
	for simulations of light induced processes in water. The good performance
	of the density functional theory functionals to model the water photoelectron
	spectra also reflects their ability to reliably describe open shell
	excited states. The width of the photoelectron spectrum converges
	quickly with the cluster size as it is controlled by specific interactions
	of local character. The peak position is, on the other hand, defined
	by long-range non-specific solvent effects; it therefore only slowly
	converges to the corresponding bulk value. We are able to reproduce
	the experimental valence photoelectron spectrum of liquid water within
	the combined model of the water octamer embedded in a polarizable
	dielectric continuum. We demonstrate that including the long-range
	polarization and the state-specific treatment of the solvent response
	are needed for a reliable liquid water ionization description.},

  abstract = {We have performed large-scale simulations of UV absorption spectra
	of water clusters (monomer to octamer) using a combination of ab
	initio path-integral molecular dynamics with reflection principle.
	The aim of the present work is four-fold: (1) To explore the transition
	from isolated molecules to bulk water from the perspective of UV
	photoabsorption. (2) To investigate quantum nuclear and thermal effects
	on the shape of the water UV spectra. (3) To make an assessment of
	the density functional theory functionals to be used for water excited
	states. (4) To check the applicability of the QM/MM schemes for a
	description of the UV absorption. Within the path integral molecular
	dynamics (PIMD)/reflection principle approach both the thermal and
	quantum vibrational effects including anharmonicities are accounted
	for. We demonstrate that shape of the spectra is primarily controlled
	by the nuclear quantum effects. The excited states and transition
	characteristics of the water clusters were calculated with the time-dependent
	density functional theory and equation-of-motion coupled clusters
	singles and doubles methods. Based on our benchmark calculations
	considering the whole UV spectrum we argue that the BHandHLYP method
	performs best among the 6 functionals tested (B3LYP, BHandHLYP, BNL,
	CAM-B3LYP, LC-$\omega$PBE, and M06HF). We observe a gradual blueshift
	of the maximum of the first absorption peak with the increasing cluster
	size. The UV absorption spectrum for the finite size clusters (i.e.,
	the peak centers, peak widths, and photoabsorption cross section)
	essentially converges into the corresponding bulk water spectrum.
	The effect of distant molecules accounted for within the polarizable
	continuum model is shown to be almost negligible. Using the natural
	transition orbitals we demonstrate that the first absorption band
	is formed by localized excitations while the second band includes
	delocalized excited states. Consequently, the QM/MM electrostatic
	embedding scheme can only be used for the modeling of the low energy
	part of the spectrum.},

	investigated by liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
	and ab initio calculations. Experimental valence electron binding
	energies of the H(2)O(2) orbitals in water are, on average, 1.9 eV
	red-shifted with respect to the gas-phase molecule. A smaller width
	of the first peak was observed in the photoelectron spectrum from
	the solution. Our experiment is complemented by simulated photoelectron
	spectra, calculated at the ab initio level of theory (with EOM-IP-CCSD
	and DFT methods), and using path-integral sampling of the ground-state
	density. The observed shift in ionization energy upon solvation is
	attributed to a combination of nonspecific electrostatic effects
	(long-range polarization) and of the specific interactions between
	H(2)O(2) and H(2)O molecules in the first solvation shell. Changes
	in peak widths are found to result from merging of the two lowest

	to the classically calculated liquid heat capacities result in agreement

  abstract = {The combined effect of thermal fluctuations and quantum mechanical
	motion on the HCl(H2O)4 cluster is studied at different temperatures.
	Two conformations of this cluster are investigated: the ringlike
	structure that involves an undissociated HCl molecule (UD) and the
	contact ion pair (CIP), which involves the dissociated acid, Cl(-),
	and H3O(+). The UD structure is affected by thermal and quantum fluctuations
	in a similar way. The hydrogen-bond network is destabilized, and
	this results in ring expansion and proton orientational rearrangements,
	though the thermal excitation prevails over the quantum effects at
	high temperature, while the zero-point motion dominates in the low-temperature
	regime, as expected. In contrast, the thermal and quantum fluctuations
	exert competing effects on the CIP structure. At high temperature
	one of the hydrogen bonds accepted by Cl(-) breaks, and this results
	in undercoordination of the Cl site, which leads to proton transfer
	along the fluxional Cl(-)···H3O(+) hydrogen bond and formation of
	molecular HCl. Thus, thermal fluctuations counteract acid dissociation
	and thus ion-pair formation. At low temperature however, the decreasing
	thermal excitations facilitate recovery of the full hydrogen-bond
	network, which pushes the proton away from the Cl site and thus leads
	to acid dissociation, which characterizes the equilibrium structure.
	On the other hand, quantum mechanical fluctuations, which destabilize
	the hydrogen bonds supporting the Cl(-) ion and pull the proton back
	towards the undissociated limit, become of overriding importance
	in the low-temperature limit. As a result, the subtle balance between
	the two trends enables temperature-dependent "low-barrier hydrogen
	bonding" and establishes a centered hydrogen bond, H2O···H(+)···Cl(-),
	at intermediate temperatures.},

  abstract = {In the effort to develop atomistic models capable of accurately describing
	nanoscale systems with complex interfaces, it has become clear that
	simple treatments with rigid charge distributions and dispersion
	coefficients selected to generate bulk properties are insufficient
	to predict important physical properties. The quantum Drude oscillator
	model, a system of one-electron pseudoatoms whose "pseudoelectrons"
	are harmonically bound to their respective "pseudonuclei," is capable
	of treating many-body polarization and dispersion interactions in
	molecular systems on an equal footing due to the ability of the pseudoatoms
	to mimic the long-range interactions that characterize real materials.
	Using imaginary time path integration, the Drude oscillator model
	can, in principle, be solved in computer operation counts that scale
	linearly with the number of atoms in the system. In practice, however,
	standard expressions for the energy and pressure, including the commonly
	used virial estimator, have extremely large variances that require
	untenably long simulation times to generate converged averages. In
	this paper, low-variance estimators for the internal energy are derived,
	in which the large zero-point energy of the oscillators does not
	contribute to the variance. The new estimators are applicable to
	any system of harmonic oscillators coupled to one another (or to
	the environment) via an arbitrary set of anharmonic interactions.
	The variance of the new estimators is found to be much smaller than
	standard estimators in three example problems, a one-dimensional
	anharmonic oscillator and quantum Drude models of the xenon dimer
	and solid (fcc) xenon, respectively, yielding 2-3 orders of magnitude
	improvement in computational efficiency. (c) 2007 American Institute

  abstract = {A general and rigorous methodology to compute the quantum equilibrium
	isotope effect is described. Unlike standard approaches, ours does
	not assume separability of rotational and vibrational motions and
	does not make the harmonic approximation for vibrations or rigid
	rotor approximation for the rotations. In particular, zero point
	energy and anharmonicity effects are described correctly quantum
	mechanically. The approach is based on the thermodynamic integration
	with respect to the mass of isotopes and on the Feynman path integral
	representation of the partition function. An efficient estimator
	for the derivative of free energy is used whose statistical error
	is independent of the number of imaginary time slices in the path
	integral, speeding up calculations by a factor of similar to 60 at
	500 K and more at room temperature. We describe the implementation
	of the methodology in the molecular dynamics package AMBER 10. The
	method is tested on three [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shift reactions.
	Because of the computational expense, we use ab initio potentials
	to evaluate the equilibrium isotope effects within the harmonic approximation
	and then the path integral method together with semiempirical potentials
	to evaluate the anharmonicity corrections. Our calculations show
	that the anharmonicity effects amount up to 30\% of the symmetry
	reduced reaction free energy. The numerical results are compared
	with recent experiments of Doering et al., [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128,
	9080 (2006); 129, 2488 (2007)] confirming the accuracy of the most
	recent measurement on 2,4,6,7,9-pentamethyl-5-(5,5-(2)H(2))methylene-11,11a-dihydro-12H-
	naphthacene as well as concerns about compromised accuracy, due to
	side reactions, of another measurement on 2-methyl-10-(10,10-(2)H(2))
