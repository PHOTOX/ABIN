Sampling harmonic wavefunction with FMS, brief tutorial

Important note: there are different versions of the code,
here we describe the version of Dan Hollas, which depends 
on recent implementation of FMS in MOLPRO2012
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
Step 1: Optimizing geometry
Files: opt.com
-----------------------------------------

-the optimization can be done e.g. on the MP2 level
-output geometry in angstrom is found in opt.com.log

-----------------------------------------
Step 2: Frequency calculations
Files: freq.com
-----------------------------------------

- can be done at MP2 level (numerically), the level must be the same as for the optimization!!
- for parallel jobs :as numerical hessian is 'embarassingly parallel' problem, you should use the MPPX parallel version as:
MX yourinput.com queue ncpu
(see http://www.molpro.net/info/2012.1/doc/manual/node8.html for details)

-----------------------------------------
Step 3: Frequency processing 
Files: mp2freq
-----------------------------------------

- take freq.com.out and add a first line "number-of-atom number-of-normal-modes"
-process it with ./mp2freq < freq.com.out > Frequencies.dat
-the Frequencies.dat file should be stripped off the low frequency modes (i.e. below 500 cm^-1,to be done manually)
-Then, move Frequencies.dat into FMSINPOUT directory

-----------------------------------------
Step 4: Making Geometry.dat and geometry.xyz
Files: molgeom.sh
-----------------------------------------
see this www for info about the format of Geometry.dat file
http://www.molpro.net/info/2012.1/doc/manual/node382.html

Geometry.dat and geometry.xyz contain the minimum geometry of the molecule.
You can use the molgeom.sh script to extract the xyz geometry in angstroms from freq.com.out as:
./molgeom.sh freq.com.out > FMSINPOUT/geometry.xyz
You should then edit geometry.xyz so that there is only one geometry. (there will probably be 2 same geometries)
Then you can copy geometry.xyz into Geometry.dat and exchange first two lines
and adding  UNITS=ANG on the first line

-----------------------------------------
Step 5: Running the FMS
Files: wigner_sampling.sh, input.com, randsum
-----------------------------------------
input.com is a generic input for molpro. It does not need to be edited.

You need to edit wigner_sampling.sh.
- number of atoms, number of generated geometries
- masses for atoms other than H, C, N, O, S, F, Cl
- note, that gaussian widths are completely arbitrary, since we are not even running FMS but simple AIMD

-Traj.x files are being generated in directory FMSTRAJS

-----------------------------------------
Step 6: Processing the trajectories 
Files: make_restart
-----------------------------------------

-The Traj.x can be converted into restart.xyz and mini.dat using "make_restart.f90". 
This code needs the file "atoms.dat", which contains the list of atom names.
It than automatically assigns correct mass to common atoms of periodic table (including deuterium as D).
If you need some other atoms or different isotopes, you have to manually adjust the subroutine "mass_init". 

-----------------------------------------
Step 7: Running multiple MD runs 
files:  create_wignertrajectories,make_restart, Abin files
-----------------------------------------
-Traj.x required
-it uses "make_restart"
-in the directory, one needs to have abin executable file, MOLPRO directory,input.in,r.abin
Note that the first line of input.in must be "&general"!!!!!
See README in folder ABIN-MULTIPLE-TRAJS for more details

-----------------------------------------
Note1: Analyzing distributions from wigner sampling
Files: analyze_wigner.f90
-----------------------------------------
For the analysis of bond distances, angles and dihedrals, there's a fortran code analyze_wigner.
For help, type ./analyze_wigner -h

-----------------------------------------
Note2: Running simulations for different isotopologues
-----------------------------------------
-the mass of atoms has to be changed in frequency calculations

-the mass has to be changed also in wigner_sampling.sh (or Control.dat)

-It has to be edited for the dynamics in ABIN (make_restart.f90 and input.in)
