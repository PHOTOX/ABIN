# Definition of the CASSCF wavefunction
basis="6-31g*" # for Pople basis sets and df-casscf, fitting DF basis must be specified manually
               # don't use Dunning basis sets, you won't get NACME
nelectrons=22  # total number of electrons
spin=0         # 0 for singlet, 1 for dublet etc.
nocc=14        # occupied orbitals
nclosed=8      # closed orbitals
memory=70      # molpro memory in MegaWords (1MW = 8 MB)
multi="multi"  # use  "df-casscf" for density fitting version
