Restart for SH might be wrong due to different overlap between old and new NACM.
We should somehow include NACM in some other restart file and read it if present.
But what about the failed and restarted runs?
Maybe, we could check the absolute values from restart and calculated,
but this is getting somehow quite complicated.
Ooor, better, we should not read it if it\=0
Currently, restart for SH is forbidden, unless it=0.

bug: floating point exception when inose=1 and temp=1.0(or even 10)
present in alpha version as well
file nosehoover.f90:356
356           Gx(inh+1)=pnhx(iat,iw,inh)**2/Qm(iw)-temp
maybe just wrong default thermostat parameters?
see hollas@as67-1:~/TEST/PIMD.g09new
works with tau0>0.002, we should test this value for cases when NHC drifts

I think that hop is wrong, we should not use vx_int
and also, after hop, in vx_int arrays will suddenly change...
maybe it would be easiest to just hop once per big time step??
