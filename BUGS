type: enhancement
what should be the default value of tau0,
to achieve best energy conservation?
Affected routines: Nose-Hoover
Present since version/commit: always
Status: UNRESOLVED
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Restart for SH might be wrong due to different overlap between old and new NACM.
We should somehow include NACM in some other restart file and read it if present.
Present since version/commit: always
Affected: surface hopping
Status:   RESOLVED in commit c5b9862,  pop.dat ok,
restart.xyz still differ due to different eshift after restart
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL: Do we do correctly inac=1??
what if sign of dotproduct changes???
Present since version/commit: always
Affected: surface hopping
Status:   UNRESOLVED, lukas thinks it is dealt with in his TDC code
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
I think that hop is wrong, we should not use vx_int
and also, after hop, in vx_int arrays will suddenly change...
maybe it would be easiest to just hop once per big time step??
UPDATE: relatively small correction (0.02eV)
when not using _int, conservation is perfect
Present since version/commit: always
Affected: surface hopping
Status:   PARTIALLY RESOLVED in commit 8ff3835, we should test it!!

BUG in SH after hop, we did not update eclas,
which results in weird peaks in energies.dat
Present since version/commit: always
Affected: surface hopping
Status:   FIXED in commit 66a5092e29b0e7004bc94d591d5cdb93ddf085df

INCORRECT INITIALIZATION FOR PNH arrays in inithnc,
causing floating point exception when inose=1 and temp=1.0
Affected routines: Nose-Hoover
Present since version/commit: always
Status: FIXED in commit c0cf32c2b65e7248ccc622a363ecc6cba60c93a7
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
FATAL bug for isbc=0,noninitialized variable xcm,
causing drift in center-of-mass and therefore wrong dynamics
Present since version/commit: initial commit, not in alpha version
Affected: periodic boundary conditions
Status:   FIXED, commit: 1c962be
