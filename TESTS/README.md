# ABIN TEST SUITE

META-TODO: write a readme for this test suit,
especially how to write new tests

TODO: document, what exactly each test is testing

Effectively, these are all high level integration tests.
It would be nice to have unit tests as well.

### Missing tests

- test for spline potential
- test for MM potential
- tests for Landau-Zener SH
